### Hi there, I am Calvin. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer adept at designing and developing scalable, high-performance full-stack web and mobile applications. I'm very passionate about learning and applying new technologies along with my critical thinking to explore and solve real-world problems. I spent a few years worked as an Architecture Designer, but the rapidly growing software technologies inspired me to be a Full Stack Software Engineer.
    
## Some tools that I use:

### Front End 
JavaScript | TypeScript | React | Redux | Next | HTML | CSS | Styled-components | Figma

### Back End
